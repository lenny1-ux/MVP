## Introduction

Welcome to Lefarm.com, your one-stop destination for fresh farm products directly from highly productive villages to the market. Our mission is to bridge the gap between farmers and customers, making it easier for farmers to sell their produce and for customers to buy fresh products conveniently.

## Project Inspiration 🌱

The inspiration for Lefarm.com came from the lack of reliable means of connecting farmers from my village, which is highly productive, to the market where those products would be sold. Growing up in this village, I witnessed firsthand the challenges that farmers face in accessing markets. This project is a way to give back to my community and empower farmers with technology.
